The second goal has also been mentioned: making human beings go back to their nature and to the natural path of surrendering to God. And this goal is manifested in all rituals of hajj. Therefore, hajj contains great goals and one of these goals is renouncing polytheists [bara'a] and Prophet Ibrahim was the most important manifestation of renouncing polytheists.

Before instilling a sense of confidence into the people of Iran, Imam (r.a.) first revived this sense of self-confidence in himself. He exhibited his faith in his capabilities in the true sense of the word. On the anniversary of Ashura in the year 1342, while he was alone, Imam (r.a.) threatened the Shah that he would ask the people of Iran to force him out of the country if he continued acting like that.

According to Islamic narrations, â€œThe light of hajj does not dim on the pilgrims unless they sin.â€ That is to say, hajj pilgrims return with the light of hajj and this light shows itself both in their human nature and their activities in society until they commit a sin, which gradually destroys the light.	"Muna da wata riwaya da take cewa: ""Hasken aiki hajji zai ci gaba da kasancewa tare da alhaji matukar bai aikata zunubi ba', wato alhaji zai dawo ne da hasken da ke tattare da aikin hajji, sannan kuma wannan hasken zai ci gaba da zama tare da shi da kuma bayyana cikin ayyuka da al'ummarsa har zuwa lokacin da abin Allah ya kiyaye ya aikata zunubi, to a lokacin kan a hankali a hankali haske zai ci gaba da gushewa."	1
These messages are handed out during hajj. They are translated into around ten languages and are handed out in Mena and other places during the hajj season.	Na biyu dai ana watsa wannan sakon a wajen sannan kuma mai yiyuwa ne ana fassara shi cikin yarurruka daban daban da yada su a lokacin hajjin, a Mina haka nan kuma a wani waje na daban, sannan kuma ya shiga hannun dukkanin alhazai a matsayin sakon juyin juya halin Musulunci.	1

Based on the Holy Quran, maybe the biggest goal of hajj is the connection between the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the prophets throughout history. That is to say, according to Sura al-Baqara, it began with the creation of Adam and Eve when angels prostrated in front of them, their experiences in paradise, their banishment to earth and finally their use of their heavenly experiences, including committing sins, repenting and complete submission to divine commands.
